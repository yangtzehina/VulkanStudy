# gl_path_rendering_CMYK

This sample shows how to use NVIDIA path rendering extension.

It also exposes it through FBO (Frame-buffer-objects) and shows how to work on CMYK-Alpha format.

Additional repositories needed:
* shared_sources
* shared_external: contains some tools/libraries to be compiled and accessible for samples to link with.
cmake can either locate them from this folder, or locate them if they are somewhere else in your computer.
