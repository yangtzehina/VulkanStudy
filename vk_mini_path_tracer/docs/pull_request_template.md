Thanks for creating a pull request for `vk_mini_path_tracer`!
Please note that this project uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) for pull requests,
to make sure that it is legally OK for the project to use the contribution for instance.
This means that you'll need to sign off on your commits, saying that they comply
with the DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin), before we can accept the pull request.

To do this (if you haven't already), create your commits using the `--signoff` flag:

`git commit --signoff`

or to add a signoff to your previous commit, use:

`git commit --amend --signoff` followed by `git push --force-with-lease`.

To add a signoff to the `N` previous commits, where `N` is a valid number, use:

`git rebase HEAD~N --signoff` followed by `git push --force-with-lease`.

If you don't add a DCO sign off, the DCO Bot will let you know; you can click on
"Details" and it'll help by letting you know what commands to run.
