# NVIDIA Vulkan Ray Tracing Tutorial

The focus of this document and the provided code is to showcase a basic integration of 
ray tracing within an existing Vulkan sample, using the 
[`VK_NV_ray_tracing`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VK_NV_ray_tracing) extension. 
This tutorial starts from a basic Vulkan application and provides step-by-step instructions to modify and add methods and functions. 
The sections are organized by components, with subsections identifying the modified functions.
